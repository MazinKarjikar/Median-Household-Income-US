# A Data Science/Machine Learning Project on Factors of Median Household Income in the US

This project employs data science practices and machine learning methods on real world data from publicly accesible datasets. The data was collected from reliable sources such as the FBI and the Census Bureau. The goal was to gather data on various factors, perform feature engineering to determine important factors, and finally fit a linear regression model in order to predict median household income given those factors.

Provided is a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MazinKarjikar/Median-Household-Income-US/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb) tutorial explaining each step of the analysis, data visualization, and the results. The python data science libraries used include `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.
